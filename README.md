# Murderer On Maple Ave
The Murderer of Maple Ave is a text-based adventure game that was made in Python and played in Trinket. There are hundreds of differnet path combinations that the player can choose in the game, which lead to 3 different endings. Each path combination the user takes uniquely changes the in-game content the player experiences.

An online demo of this game is playable via the website in my bio, or you can download here to play the full game.
